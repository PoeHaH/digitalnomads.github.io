# Chiang Mai Starter Kit

## <a name="where-to-stay"></a>Where to Stay

The consencus amongst people staying for a longer period (1 month and more) in Chiang Mai is that it's easier to just get there, walk around and find a place. There's a lot of areas in Chiang Mai that would appeal to different kind of people. Same thing with apartments / guest houses / hostels. 

So, to know where you're going at first, simply rent a guest house / hostel / hotel / air'bnb place online for 2-3 nights in an [area](#areas) you think you will like and walk around to find a place for longer term. To rent something online, often the cheapest options are on [agoda](https://www.agoda.com) or [hotelquickly.com](https://www.hotelquickly.com). Keep in mind that Airbnb is generally more expensive than any other options. And booking online is generally more expensive than 'walk-in prices'.

Useful links to find a place for long term stay (1 month or more):

* [Chiang Mai Apartments under THB10000 for Digital Nomads](http://blog.chrisgrabinski.com/2015/04/26/monthly-apartment-rentals-in-chiang-mai/)
* [Chiang Mai Buddy - Cheap Hotels: Weekly or Monthly Apartment Accommodation in Chiang Mai Thailand](http://www.chiangmaibuddy.com/accommodation-chiang-mai/)

Some other tips:

* When you walk around and visit serviced apartments/guest houses/hostels you can ask to see the room before. 
* You can ask for discounts if you stay longer. It probably won't work in places where they alreay have monthly prices (like serviced apartments), but it's worth a try in guest houses.


### Songkran and Other Holidays

It would be wise to rent something before getting in Chiang Mai you plan on arriving during Songkran (Thailand's new year). It lasts 3 days officially in Thailand, but in Chiang Mai the festivities are lasting more like 5 days, and during these days the price of accomodations are obviously more expensive (sometimes double). 

During high season (November to beginning of February) it can be bit more difficult to find something at the last minute, but definitely not impossible.


## <a name="areas"></a> Areas

### Nimman

Often described as the 'hipster' area, this area (mostly on or around Nimman street) has a lot of cafes where you can work from. There's also restaurants with good western food and, of course, a lot of thai food places with different price range.

A lot of digital nomads like to stay there because there's a lot of different places where you can comfortably work from (big cafes and coworking spaces) with decent wifis.


### The Old City

The old city is the 'square' area (if you look at a map), surrounded by a moat (small river). Backpackers often go there, mostly in the north east. This place has a lot of guest houses and restaurants.


### Around the Night Market

This area is where the 'traditional' tourists are staying.

## Getting Around

* You can get around in Songthaews (red trucks). You stop them when you see one, tell them where you're going. If they can go there, they will bring you.
** Most of the drivers know the landmarks (gates at the old city, big shopping malls, temples, markets). However, trying to show them a map (paper or on your phone) can be a challenge because most of them aren't used to reading/using maps. 
** When you stop one, just tell them where you're going. If they agree, don't wait there for a price nor ask for one, go right at the back of the truck. The fix price is 20 bahts. When you arrive, get out, and pay the driver. 
** For longer distances, the driver will tell you the price if it's different than 20 bahts. Sometimes it's somewhat random, so you can try to negotiate or simply don't get in if you think it's too expensive.
* You can rent a scooter in Chiang Mai to get around that huge area. If you want to go to places like in the mountains, waterfalls or simply explore, it's probably the best option. 
** Check with your insurances / what you can drive legally with your driver's license at home. It's possible that you won't be covered in case of an accident.
** It's illegal not to wear a helmet. If you drive without one, you can get arrested and you'll need to pay a fine.
** After 3 months in Thailand, you have to have a Thai drivers license. Again, if you don't have one, you can get arrested and will have to pay a fine.
** It's helpful to have an international driving licence when driving in Thailand, otherwise you could be fined.
* Tuk-tuks are usually more expensive than other alternatives. 
* Taxis are less common than say in Bangkok. You usually have to phone one if you need a pickup. You can also ask  at your accommodation if you need one.


## Wifi and Internet Access

It's hard to predict how the wifi is going to act in specific places. Sometimes you can go to an apartment and it's lightning fast. Then, 3 days later, it doesn't work at all. Same with coffee places. Generally speaking, in serviced apartments they're better (with more wifi points), but they can get crowded too.

Alternatives in case the wifi you use doesn't work well:

* Get a sim with a data plan or wifi access (providing you're near a wifi spot)
* Having your own modem installed in your place (ask before you rent, it's not always possible). It's generally way faster and more predictable, but keep in mind that it's also possible to have an outage of a couple of minutes (can be as long as 1 hour). It doesn't happen often, but it's possible.
* Go to a coworking place
* Go to another coffee place. There's a lot of them, there's always a good wifi connection somewhere!


## Sims &amp; Data Plans

There's a couple of different data plans and companies out there, and their website aren't always easy to understand. Here's a couple of tips/info:

* If you're staying in the Nimman area, AIS has a fast wifi point in Maya Mall where you can work from 24 hours (in 'Camp')
* If your phone is unlocked you won't have any problem getting a sim.
* There's a lot of monthly plans or 'pay as you go' plan without any need to get a contract.
* You can get 6 gig (sometimes 12 gig) for around 30 USD per month. And it's usually fast and reliable. 
* Chiang Mai now has 4G speed.
* AIS have normally a better coverage over Chiang Mai. DTAC has good plans too.
* To buy a sim, you'll need to show your passport. 
* You can buy a sim card in most of the malls. 
* You can 'recharge' your sim card online or at 7 eleven.
* Unlimited plans are usually not that 'unlimited'. They usually have a data cap and gets slower after that. You can use your emails with these, but using your connection with your laptop will be really slow. So, if you see a 2gig at 4g Unlimited plan, it usually means you have 2 gig with a '4g speed', but then the speed will decrease after you reach that 2 gig cap of download.


## Visas / Visa Extensions / Visa Run

* There's a '30 days free entry' in Thailand. Just check the requirements VS your citizenship.
* You can usually get a tourist visas (depending on your citizenship) with multiple entries. Each entry is good for 2 months, which you can extend for 1 more month. You can get 1, 2 or 3 entries visa. So the longest you can get with a visa would be 3 entries (of 2 months each) and extend them of one more month each time. Which would be a total of 9 months.
* It gets more and more difficult to get in and out all the time without visas (on 30 days free entries). If you do that, it's preferable if you spend a couple of days (like a week) in other countries before coming back to Thailand.
* If you're already in Thailand and want a visa, you need to get out in another country. [Here's an article with a couple of other countries where you can go to get a visa for Thailand](http://live-less-ordinary.com/cheapest-thai-visa-runs-from-bangkok/)
* If your visa or '30 days free entry' is ending, you can usually extend it for 30 more days (check the visa requirements for your country).
