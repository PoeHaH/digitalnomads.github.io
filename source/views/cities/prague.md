Prague is one of the most popular digital nomad destinations in Europe. It’s also the first European destination you’ll see on Nomad List. It’s not surprising that Prague is such a popular destination.

First, Prague is incredibly cheap to live in. Nomad List quotes around a thousand US dollars per month. An espresso will run you around 1.50 USD, if not less. A beer will cost you 2 USD. A monthly public transport ticket is available for 670 CZK, around 30 USD, and covers trams, metro’s and busses.

Then there’s the cafe culture. Prague is littered with cafe’s. From the slightly dodgy one in the neighborhood to full-blown hipster. Most, if not all, have wifi that’s quick and staff that speak English.

When you need a break from working, the city itself is absolutely gorgeous. Small medieval streets, brilliant views from the castle, the banks of the wide river. It’s easy to get inspired in a place like this.

### Where to get the best SIM-card with mobile data and WiFi

The Czech Republic has three mobile networks: O2, T-Mobile and Vodafone. You can get a SIM-card from their local shops.

Tesco and COOP also offer SIM-cards, on the Vodafone and T-Mobile network respectively. They’re on the same network and usually a bit cheaper. There aren’t many COOP’s in Prague, so Tesco is probably your best bet.

You don’t need a passport or address to buy a SIM-card. Texts will usually be in Czech though, so either ask the employees in the shop to help you, or make sure you have Google Translate at hand.

For up-to-date information on prices visit [](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Czech_Republic)[http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Czech_Republic](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Czech_Republic).

### How to find the fastest WiFi connections

Most cafe’s in Prague have fast and reliable internet, so do most apartments. If you’re not sure, or want to know the password before you get there, look for the cafe on Foursquare or Yelp.

### How to meet other digital nomads

Digital Nomads are less concentrated in Prague than, say, Chiang Mai. You’ll have to actively look out for them, [](http://findanomad.com/)[http://findanomad.com/](http://findanomad.com/), Meetup.com and the Expats in Prague group.

Nomad List organizes regular meetups, see [](http://nomadlist.com/meetups)[http://nomadlist.com/meetups](http://nomadlist.com/meetups).

There's also a dedicated #prague channel with 100+ nomads to chat with on [](http://hashtagnomads.com)[http://hashtagnomads.com](http://hashtagnomads.com), Nomad List's chat community.

### When to come

Summers in Prague mean tourists. It’s one of the most popular destinations in Europe and in the summer it shows. Prices go up and the centre, especially near Charles Bridge, becomes enormously crowded. There’s also a chance of pretty heavy rainstorms. Temperature is nice though, averaging 24 °C (75 °F).

Spring and fall see less tourists with slightly colder weather. Winters can get pretty cold and it will probably snow, although you won’t find more than 10-20 cm at any one time.

### How to get around?

#### Getting to Prague:

PRG is a well-connected airport. If you’re in Europe look at Wizz Air, EasyJet and Jet2.com (UK). They offer low-cost flights. The national airline is Czech Airlines, who operate flights to most European locations. There are no direct flights outside the EU except for Russia.

When you arrive at the airport, you have a few options for getting into the city: Airport Express: Runs a direct line to Dejvická, Náměstí Republiky and the train station. Tickets are available from the driver for 60 CZK. The bus: either bus 119 or AE takes you to Dejvická metro station, which will bring you into the rest of the city. There’s a kiosk in Terminal 1 and 2 that accepts CC. You can also buy tickets from the vending machine (32 CZK) or the driver (40 CZK). None accept foreign currency, so make sure you exchange some money in the terminal. Cedaz bus: Takes you directly to V Celnici, close to the Hilton, Marriott and Náměstí Republiky. 150 CZK. For timetables check: [](http://www.cedaz.cz/public-shuttle-bus-from-airport-to-prague-centre.php)[http://www.cedaz.cz/public-shuttle-bus-from-airport-to-prague-centre.php](http://www.cedaz.cz/public-shuttle-bus-from-airport-to-prague-centre.php)Taxi: AAA Taxi and FIX cars have an exclusive contract with Prague airport. Both have desks in the terminal. Between 650 CZK and 850 CZK.

Prague is also well connected by train as well. Berlin: 4¾h, EC trains every 2 hours Munich: 5¾h, 4 regional expresses a day. Alternatively you can use non-stop bus operated by German Railways (5h, 4 buses a day). Vienna: 4¾h, EC train roughly every 2 hours Linz: 5h, 2 REX trains a day Bratislava: 4h, EC train every 2 hours; one night train Metropol Budapest: 7h, 5 EC trains a day; one night train Metropol Warsaw: 8h, 3 EC trains with transfer in Ostrava; one night train Šírava

#### Getting around in Prague:

The Prague public transport system is well connected and cheap. Google Maps does a great job at calculating routes for you.

It’s a well known fact in Prague that ticket checking is sporadic at best. There are no physical barriers at metro stations and the bus driver won’t ask you for your ticket. That being said, it’d be a very silly idea to not carry a ticket.

There are a few types of tickets available. 30-minute, 90-minute, 24 hours or 3 day tickets are all valid for bus, tram and metro and come with unlimited transfers. Tickets are available from ticket machines all over the city, tobacco shops, Public Transit offices or via sms. The ticket machines don’t offer the 3-day option.

You have to buy tickets before you enter the metro or tram. In a bus or tram you’re able to validate the ticket on-board, in the yellow boxes. On the metro you’re able to validate them in the yellow boxes, usually before the stairs. On the bus you’re also able to buy tickets from the driver, but they’re more expensive.

If you’re planning on staying for a longer period you can also buy a monthly, 90-day or annual ticket. You can put these tickets on your name. This is cheaper, but involves a 3 hour search for the right office, filling in a form with numerous questions and supplying them with a photo.

I gave up halfway through and instead bought a transferable pass which is slightly more expensive. You can buy it at the offices at the metro station Můstek B.

A full overview of fares can be found here: [](http://www.dpp.cz/en/fares-in-prague/)[http://www.dpp.cz/en/fares-in-prague/](http://www.dpp.cz/en/fares-in-prague/).

### Where should you live?

Prague’s centre is Prague 1\. This is where most of the sights (like the astronomical clock and the old town) are. It’s a slightly more touristy area, and also a bit more expensive. There are a lot of bars, cafe’s and restaurants in the neighborhood.

If you’re not staying in Prague 1, you’ll want to be very close to it. Prague 2, 3, 7 are great options. Slightly more residential, and with great connections to Prague 1\.

Prague 7 deserves an extra mention. It’s a residential area that’s well connected with the centre. It also has a lot cafe’s, of whom most have wifi.

### How and where to find an apartment?

AirBnB has thousands of apartments for rental in Prague, most in the neighborhoods mentioned above.[](http://www.your-apartments.com/)[http://www.your-apartments.com/](http://www.your-apartments.com/) is a local company with an English site. At the time of writing it lists 380 apartments.[](http://www.vrbo.com/)[http://www.vrbo.com/](http://www.vrbo.com/) lists around 704 appartments at the time of writing. Some great deals can be found here, and the site itself usually doesn’t charge anything. The Prague version of Craigslist lists a few holiday homes in Prague: [](http://prague.craigslist.cz)[http://prague.craigslist.cz](http://prague.craigslist.cz). For long term rentals (6+ months), take a look at [](http://reality.idnes.cz)[http://reality.idnes.cz](http://reality.idnes.cz) and [](http://www.sreality.cz)[http://www.sreality.cz](http://www.sreality.cz).

### Current prices of food, shelter and more

An apartment for a month is around 10.000 CZK. A low end hotel/hostel room goes for around 250 CZK. A basic meal is CZK 100, a beer around 30-40 CZK. A transport pass for a month is 670 CZK, a single 90-minute ticket 32 CZK.

How to stay safe in Prague and which places to avoid

Pickpocketing is a big problem in Prague. As in any big city, use common sense and keep your things close. Pickpocketing mostly happens around crowded and touristy areas like Charles Bridge and the Old Town Square.

Taxi drivers, especially from the station, are known to scam tourists. Make sure you agree on a price and ask for a receipt. A better bet is to ask a restaurant/hotel to call a taxi for you, or use AAA Taxi ([](http://www.aaataxi.cz/)[http://www.aaataxi.cz/](http://www.aaataxi.cz/), +420222333222).

Sometimes a team of con artists hold up at the entrance of a Metro station, pretending to be ticket inspectors. They’ll inspect your ticket and explain that it isn’t valid. Ask for their badge, and if you’re not sure call the police.

If you walk through the Old Town Square at night (mostly as a male) you’ll probably be approached for weed or girls. If you’re uncomfortable with this try to avoid the area after dark.

What to do in case of an emergency (eg. medical emergencies)

For any emergency call 112.

Hospitals: Na Homolce (Roentgenova 2/37, +420 257 271 111) and Motol (V Úvalu 84, +420 224 431 111) both have facilities for English speakers.

Which Czech customs you should be aware of

The Czech Republic is a modern Central European country. There’s no need to worry about offending the people. That being said, it’s still good practice to follow a few pointers.

First, learn some Czech phrases. A simple hello (Dobrý den. (DOH-bree dehn)), goodbye (Na shledanou (NAHSH-leh-dah-noh)) and thank you (Děkuji. (Dyekooyih.)) will get you a long way. For a handy list of phrases check [](http://wikitravel.org/en/Czech_phrasebook)[http://wikitravel.org/en/Czech_phrasebook](http://wikitravel.org/en/Czech_phrasebook).

It’s probably also best to steer clear of political discussions. The Czech Republic has had a rather turbulent past.

Certain Eastern European influences are noticeable in the country, especially not smiling. Even in stores, cafes or restaurants people will rarely smile. This isn’t because they’re upset or angry, it’s just their standard expression. Don’t let this discourage you though, smiling back still helps.

### Coworking spaces vouched for by nomads

Můj šálek kávy. (Adres: Křižíkova 105, [](http://4sq.com/1F1Zip3))[http://4sq.com/1F1Zip3](http://4sq.com/1F1Zip3)). Fast wifi, great food. In a quiet residential area.

Kidó (Šmeralova 22, [](http://4sq.com/ApdRim))[http://4sq.com/ApdRim](http://4sq.com/ApdRim)). Patchy wifi, but great interior, huge garden.

Nacafe (Šmeralova 15, [](http://4sq.com/10zZfxi))[http://4sq.com/10zZfxi](http://4sq.com/10zZfxi)). Quick wifi, a lot of seating space. Smokers are allowed inside though.

La Bohème Café (Sázavská 32, [](http://4sq.com/OJt1OA))[http://4sq.com/OJt1OA](http://4sq.com/OJt1OA)). Very hip and always busy. Quite a few seating areas, but a lot are low chairs without table. If you manage to get a table it’s a brilliant place, with great coffee and fast wifi.

Kavárna Pražírna (Lublaňská 676/50, [](http://4sq.com/Ab0hZX))[http://4sq.com/Ab0hZX](http://4sq.com/Ab0hZX)). A quiet cafe located in a basement. Good coffee and a selection of food.

Mezi zrnky (Sázavská 720/19, [](http://4sq.com/Q7XqCN))[http://4sq.com/Q7XqCN](http://4sq.com/Q7XqCN)). Tiny space, only four tables. Their staff know their way around a coffee machine. If you can’t find a space here you can always hop over to La Bohème, which is around the corner.

Starbucks (Hradčanské nám., [](http://4sq.com/1452UJl))[http://4sq.com/1452UJl](http://4sq.com/1452UJl)). I know, I know, Starbucks is the literal representation of evil on earth and one of the most boring choices in a place to work. However, this place is a little different. First, it’s huge, with loads of places to sit both inside and outside. Second, the views are the best. It’s situated just under the castle and from your office you’ll be able to see the whole city.

Original Coffee (Betlémská 12, [](http://4sq.com/1bYTSRU))[http://4sq.com/1bYTSRU](http://4sq.com/1bYTSRU)). These guys are very big on coffee, sourcing and roasting it themselves. A lot of tables.

### Visas for Digital Nomads

The Czech Republic, as an EU member, is part of the Schengen area. If you’re a citizen of the Schengen area or have a Visa for the Schengen area you won’t need a Visa.

There’s also a list of countries from which people can enter under the Visa-waiver programme. This list includes the U.S.A., Mexico, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and Australia. For a full list go to [](http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/who-needs-schengen-visa/)[http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/who-needs-schengen-visa/](http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/who-needs-schengen-visa/).

The most obvious choice for Digital Nomads would be a tourist Visa. This will still allow you to work from your laptop for a company outside of the Schengen area. A business Visa is much harder to come by, and usually implies you’ll be working for a company in the Schengen area.

### How to get a business visa and how to legally register your business in Prague

If you work from your laptop and receive payment internationally, there’s very little reason to legally establish your business in the Czech Republic.

The Czech Republic has a flat Corporate Tax of 19%, and a flat Personal Income Tax of 15%. VAT is 15% for food, books and certain health care products, 21% for all other goods and services.

Setting up a Czech LLC (Limited) does not require you to have residency in or be a citizen of the Czech Republic. You will need about 200.000 CZK as minimum capital. You will also need a registred office. This requires a rental agreement or consent from the owner. There are a number of companies that can provide a virtual office.

You will also need a bank account to put the minimum capital in. This account will be unblocked when you officially register your company. The foundation deed of the company along with the articles of association and memorandum must be submitted to the bank. Some banks require the director to be present during the process, while others may be accept it if the bank account is established by a representative authorized through power of attorney.

While you can try setting up a limited yourself, it won’t be very easy. Your best bet is to find a company to do it for you. A simple Google search will bring up tens of companies that can assist you in the process.

### Which bars and clubs to visit in Prague's nightlife

Prague is famous for its nightlife. Tourists from all over the world come here to have night-long parties. There are also loads of cheap flights to and from the UK, which means that there will be loads of Stag nights (bachelor parties). Depending on where you go you’ll be able to avoid this though.

Most of the action happens in Prague 1, particularly in the area around Staroměstské náměstí and the Charles Bridge. From upscale bars (like the Hemingway bar, James Dean) to dingy underground clubs to beer halls (where you’ll share a table with other people) to massive clubs (Karlovy lázně), there’s something for everyone.

Prague is also famous for having a few cons with regard to night life. The police have been cracking down hard on these practices, but they still exist. Be wary of beautiful girls who try to take you to certain bars. Gentlemen clubs in general are pretty dingy and best avoided.

### Where to go to relax (e.g. hot springs, spas, pools, beaches)

Boscolo Prague Spa & Wellness (Senovazne Namesti 13, [](http://www.boscolospa.cz/en))[http://www.boscolospa.cz/en](http://www.boscolospa.cz/en)). A great upscale spa close to the centre. Entry is 990 CZK.

Beer Spa Bernard Prague (Týn 10, [](http://www.pivnilaznebernard.cz/))[http://www.pivnilaznebernard.cz/](http://www.pivnilaznebernard.cz/)). Prague is famous for its beer spa’s. This is an expensive one (2400 CZK) but features all the beer-bubbling you could wish for.
