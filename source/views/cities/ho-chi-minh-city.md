Known as both Ho Chi Minh City (Hồ Chí Minh) and Saigon (Sài Gòn), the city is divided into Districts, or Quận. Visitors, nomad alike, will spend the majority of their time in District 1\. Other notable districts include D3, a western extension of D1 with no noticeable transition, and D2, an expat community full of enormous international schools, imposing Rococo villas, filled with a surreal complement of Europeans pushing prams past their gated residential compounds.

For tourists, Saigon presents itself as a sprawling city of contrasts - the old, the new, the affectedly post-modern, a city built on colonialism and war.

Nomads will find a busy city, full of street life, choked on bike exhaust, with labyrithine alleyways (hẻm - [](http://vietnamcoracle.com/alley-walks-saigon/))[http://vietnamcoracle.com/alley-walks-saigon/](http://vietnamcoracle.com/alley-walks-saigon/)), hustle, entrepreneurial savvy, dynamism, beauty and grace. Not to mention one of the best places to hire motivated, educated locals.

Its enterprising populace is driven partly, under the surface, by American culture. It’s not obvious, until you stumble on the Vietnamese word Mỹ. You’ll soon be able to identify Mỹ stores carrying such American staples as Perrier, restaurants selling the renowned American noodle and American candy shops lined with bars of Toblerone.

It’s a startup town.

The currency is đồng (₫ or VND), at about 20,000 to the dollar.

## Connect

### Where to get the best SIM-card with mobile data and WiFi

Buy a Mobifone SIM card at any phone shop. Ask the staff to set up the 75,000 VND data plan for you, or text in DK MIU to 999 yourself. This gets you 600mb of fast internet,unlimited at a throttled speed.

### How to find the fastest WiFi connections

Wifi is universally fast in Vietnam. Access to overseas server is no issue, but the primary connection is via a submarine cable from abroad. When it’s cut, all of the traffic has to find alternate means, which leads to congestion. These dreaded cable cuts are seemingly an annual occurrence.

### How to meet other digital nomads

Check out Nomad List's meetups ([](https://www.facebook.com/nomadlist)[https://www.facebook.com/nomadlist](https://www.facebook.com/nomadlist)), Facebook groups and the nomad/expat haunts (mentioned at the end of this guide under Play). Foreigners tend to congregate together.

**We also have a dedicated #ho-chi-minh-city chat channel on our chat community at [http://hashtagnomads.com](http://hashtagnomads.com) with 75+ people available to talk.**

### How to get around

#### Arrival:

Most visitors will land in Tan Son Nhat (Tân Sơn Nhất) (SGN) airport. You should have picked up a visa at your local embassy - Bangkok is an especially straightforward, though not pleasant, process - or applied for a Visa on Arrival online via one of the visa letter services, like myvietnamvisa.com or evisa.com.vn (total cost for a 30 day entry, about $65, including the visa itself, which you pay for in cash at the airport).

These companies will furnish you with a letter which guarantees you a Visa on Arrival, along with instructions, like the need for a passport photo and USD. Step into the Visa on Arrival line (not an immigration line until you have a visa in your passport!).

#### Taxis:

Use only Vinasun (white) and Mai Linh (green) taxis. Their meters automatically engage and you won’t be refused a ride. Note that rival taxi companies can mimic these legitimate brands, but it’s a rather superficial counterfeiting job and you won’t be confused.

For the paranoid, consider catching a taxi at the domestic terminal two-hundred meters down the road. A Vinasun agent will flag the appropriate cab down for you. There is no charge for this service.

The total fare into D1 should be about $10, perhaps 250,000 VND. The bus runs to the backpacker area, where you shouldn’t be staying if you’re here for productivity or value your Macbook.

#### Motorbiking:

The most common mode of transportation is a scooter. You can hire your own or employ the services of a xe ôm, or motorbike taxi.

While they don’t wear a distinctive uniform as in Bangkok, they’re easy to identify, parked at a corner or in a huddle. Your xe ôm drivers will exhibit varying degrees of English-language ability, from little to none, and unpredictable levels of sobriety.

But almost to a man, they are friendly and helpful. With some guidance and the intervention of a third party in perusing your Google Map to identify the relevant cross streets, they will gamely drive you against the tide of oncoming traffic, over sidewalks and through intersections whose lights they interpret as decorative. Confirm a price upfront and expect to pay between 20 and 50,000 VND within D1, distance and traffic depending.

#### Renting a bike:

Rental bikes are usually automatics, in contrast to what you may have heard on the internet. Expect to pay about $60/month. Consider a service which won’t ask you to forfeit your passport.

Even with previous driving experience, it would be wise to take a few days on the back of someone else’s bike to understand the peculiarities of Saigon driving, to your benefit and that of your new neighbors, for whom you’ll be an obstacle under the best of circumstances.

### How to stay safe in Saigon and which places to avoid

Or, “problems that are greatly overstated, especially by the hyperbolic Wikivoyage entry.”

Crossing the street is not as bad as everyone makes out, and frankly, can be an adventure. You are a rock in a stream, traffic flows around you like a current. Don’t stop needlessly or hesitate. Move confidently forward.

Scams, theft and general unpleasantness is the preserve of Phạm Ngũ Lão/Bùi Viện - the backpacker area (the broader backpacker neighborhood is colloquially known as Phố Tây, with Tây meaning western foreigner) - and by the Bến Thành market, where goods are dramatically overpriced and your shoulder bag a highly visible target. The period leading up to Tết is the most dangerous.

Taxis are fine. Take only Vinasun and Mai Linh, which also happen to be the most common, and you’ll have no trouble at all.

Watch your bag while walking or on a motorbike. Avoid carrying your phone openly, texting away. Even if you’re deep on a sidewalk, someone can easily drive past you on a motorbike and snatch it. Don’t leave valuables on a table streetside.

Violent crime is exceedingly rare.

### What to do in case of an emergency

For serious medical matters, consider flying to Bangkok or Singapore.

Most other problems can be handled by the FV Hospital ([](http://www.fvhospital.com)[http://www.fvhospital.com](http://www.fvhospital.com)) in the Bitexco tower.

The Lonely Planet has a more complete list of clinics: [](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city/practical-information/health)[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city/practical-information/health](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city/practical-information/health)

### Which Vietnamese customs you should be aware of

Take your shoes off when you enter a home or, if you’d prefer not to, instead compliment your hosts on their lovely barn and ask which hay bale you ought relieve yourself on.

Be deferential to anyone older than you (or higher status, which is more difficult to discern).

Smile and be gracious in your haggling, but be firm and appear competent, which is not to be faked with aggression. Smile moreso when you're on the losing end of a deal, which could be in the range of a dollar, or even several dollars.

Ignore touts completely unless you want to buy what they’re selling. No need to invite a pitch with a response.

Don’t linger around market stalls, much less engage the shopkeeper, if you don’t intend to buy, lest you arouse dark superstitions and disrupt the rites of commerce.

Try to avoid arriving in the city (or travelling at all) during rush hour. Your wait at immigration and in traffic will be that much longer.

Tipping is not necessary, though will be accepted. Look for service charges included in your bill.

Be aware that it’s technically illegal and widely frowned-up for unmarried couples to sleep together (or something along those lines; you may query local legal counsel on the matter). Don’t be surprised if your building imposes some restrictions.

It should be noted that many Vietnamese have curfews, whether imposed by their families with whom they typically reside until marriage, or more absurdly, by their building’s management if they live independently.

### Eat

In the heart of District 1, it’s easy to live in an expat bubble, with competent-enough English, quality interpretations of familiar food (French, notably) and often a majority population of foreigners. But Saigon rewards the adventurous traveler.

The best English-language summary of street food in Saigon comes from Jodi Ettenberg: [](http://www.legalnomads.com/2014/06/saigon-street-food.html)[http://www.legalnomads.com/2014/06/saigon-street-food.html](http://www.legalnomads.com/2014/06/saigon-street-food.html)

You may also like the food map from Mark Wiens of Migrationology: bit.ly/mfoodmap (an example post: [](http://migrationology.com/2014/12/fried-chicken-saigon-vietnam/))[http://migrationology.com/2014/12/fried-chicken-saigon-vietnam/](http://migrationology.com/2014/12/fried-chicken-saigon-vietnam/))

As Vietnamese is written in Latin characters, with some effort, you’ll be able to interpret common menu items and signs.

Some useful terms (and do note, that, like many expressions, the meaning and pronunciation can differ greatly between Hanoi and Saigon):

bún - Vermicelli noodles.

bún chả - a grilled pork and noodle dish originating in Hanoi.

mắm - depending on the context, any number of fermented fish sauces or shrimp pastes.

bánh mì - a baguette filled with stuff; often pate, some pork. On its own, bánh can refer to cakes, breads, crepes, etc.

cà phê - coffee. The Vietnamese traditional variety is a slow drip, heavy on Robusta beans and consequently, caffeine. It comes in a few varieties: đá, or iced, sữa, with milk, or đen (không đường if you don’t want sugar). Vietnam is the world’s second largest producer of coffee and it shows.

bánh xèo, bánh khọt - a large and small sort of crepe, respectively, stuffed.

chả giò - delicious fried spring rolls. Compare with gỏi cuốn, a fresh spring roll, wrapped in rice paper (bánh tráng).

cơm tấm - broken rice-based dishes. These are especially delicious.

phở - the ubiquitous noodle soup, typically seen in beef and chicken varieties.

bún bò Huế - an excellent beef noodle soup from the central region.

Expect to pay in the range of 20-50,000 đồng for street food, more than double that in a sit-down restaurant.

### Where should you live? And how and where to find an apartment

Stay for some days first at the White Lotus Hotel (6 Thi Sách) near Japantown. Once you get your bearings, you can find a longer-term apartment for rent on Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, hẻm (alley) 18A or around Japantown. Every other building will have a “room for rent” sign up front. Negotiations will likely be in USD. You can convert the sum to đồng or pay in dollars. Expect rates between $200-500 in 18A on a month-to-month basis, but easily much more for nicer accommodations. Japantown is full of pleasant, if pricier, apartments - check the alley, 15B Lê Thánh Tôn.

Or contact Diep at Dragonfly, who has two buildings, PNT Court and HBT Court. Easy and they accept credit card payments with no deposit. [](http://dragonfly.com.vn/serviced-apartments)[http://dragonfly.com.vn/serviced-apartments](http://dragonfly.com.vn/serviced-apartments)

## Work

### Coworking spaces vouched for by nomads

With such an abundance of cafes, coworking may be the least essential of Saigon’s features. But the spaces are well designed, as they must be to compete with the cafe scene.

Work Saigon ([](http://www.worksaigon.com)[http://www.worksaigon.com](http://www.worksaigon.com)) 267/2 Dien Bien Phu, Ward 7, District 3

START Saigon ([](http://start-saigon.com)[http://start-saigon.com](http://start-saigon.com)) 18bis/14 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai (near the nomad alley, 18A)

Saigon Coworking ([](http://saigoncoworking.com)[http://saigoncoworking.com](http://saigoncoworking.com)) 101 Cu Lao, Phu Nhuan

### Places to work

Saigon has such an embarrassment of riches when it comes to cafe selection, I almost hesitate to mention specific places. Surely this city has the highest quantity of coffee available per capita.

The Workshop cafe and roaster ([](https://www.facebook.com/the.workshop.coffee)[https://www.facebook.com/the.workshop.coffee](https://www.facebook.com/the.workshop.coffee)) - for the only decent (and only decent) espresso in town. High-ceilinged, contemporary, right in the center of the business district, with lovely views.

Bâng Khuâng Café ([](https://www.facebook.com/BangkhuangCafe)[https://www.facebook.com/BangkhuangCafe](https://www.facebook.com/BangkhuangCafe)), 9 Thái Văn Lung Beautiful cafe, a bit hidden, open since the war. Food is excellent. Busy around lunch.

L’Uisine ([](http://lusinespace.com/)[http://lusinespace.com/](http://lusinespace.com/)), thoughtfully decorated boutique and cafe. Two locations: 70 Lê Lợi, Bến Thành (inside the shop, head upstairs) and 151/1 Dong Khoi St., 1st Flr., Dist. 1, Ho Chi Minh City (through an alley, to the right and upstairs)

Juicy Smoothie Bar (Adjacent to Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, hẻm (alley) 18A, a residential area full of nomads) - daily morning assembly of paleo junkies, eating bowls of bacon like potato chips, and green-smoothie lovers.

StoryM, ([](http://storymcafe.com/)[http://storymcafe.com/](http://storymcafe.com/)) 51 Trần Nhật Duật, Tân Định, Quận 1

iD Cafe (34D Thu Khoa Huan Street, District 1, Bến Thành and the even more carefully designed spot in District 3: 61 Tú Xương 7, District 3)

M2C ([](https://www.facebook.com/m2ccafe)[https://www.facebook.com/m2ccafe](https://www.facebook.com/m2ccafe), Modern Meets Culture), run by the same owners as iD Cafe, has fine food and a pleasant setting. On the way, you can watch street vendors serve food using stoops as a prep surface, a step each for the soup, limes and vegetables. (44B Lý Tự Trọn)

Stop Coffee, popular with nomads, on the other side of the Nguyen Thi Minh Khai 18A alley from Juicy. Has an upstairs area with a standing-desk bar.

Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf ([](http://www.coffeebean.com.vn/)[http://www.coffeebean.com.vn/](http://www.coffeebean.com.vn/)), international chain, many locations. The one at 27 Hàn Thuyên Bến Nghé has a secret upstairs area slightly separated from the main shop. There’s a pleasant outdoor patio at the Saigon Trade Building (37 Tôn Đức Thắng) location.

Coffee House ([](https://www.facebook.com/The.Coffee.House.2014)[https://www.facebook.com/The.Coffee.House.2014](https://www.facebook.com/The.Coffee.House.2014)) - a local chain, many locations. All have comfortable places to sit and work, with plenty of power outlets, fast wifi, professional service and loyalty cards. I prefer the one at 25 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, which features a large central table with outlets.

Coffee Factory ([](https://www.facebook.com/ThecoffeefactoryVN)[https://www.facebook.com/ThecoffeefactoryVN](https://www.facebook.com/ThecoffeefactoryVN)), many locations. Cheap, casual, open late. Try the one at Mạc Đĩnh Chi.

Trung Nguyen ([](http://www.trungnguyen.com.vn/en/)[http://www.trungnguyen.com.vn/en/](http://www.trungnguyen.com.vn/en/)) - many locations, showing their age. Try 211 Nguyễn Thái Học & Phạm Ngũ Lão.

Nest by AIA - an incredible, newly opened workspace and cafe. More details here: [](http://www.adventurefaktory.com/sgnworkcafenest/)[http://www.adventurefaktory.com/sgnworkcafenest/](http://www.adventurefaktory.com/sgnworkcafenest/). In the Bitexco Financial Tower, 2nd Floor.

## Legal

### Visas for Digital Nomads

Nomads can get by on a tourist visa, but are able to secure a business visa with relative ease. It’s best to make that arrangement while in country, via a the company sponsoring the visa. They’ll typically handle this on your behalf.

Practically speaking, you won’t run into any legal issues working remotely from Vietnam.

### How to stay as long as possible on your tourist visa

Bring sufficient USD to pay for the actual visa ($45 for a single entry, at time of writing), as ATMs dispense VND only and are on the other side of immigration, regardless. Even though this is outlined clearly by the visa assistance service, you’ll find a litany of illiterate Europeans and Australians in line with you, lacking photos, dollars, letters, pens or any sense at all. Presumably, they’ve come to teach English.

For a longer-term stay, the visa situation is fluid. Sources suggest that visa regulations are loosened immediately after the Tết Holidays (Lunar New Year). Typically, a visa can be renewed endlessly in country through grey means. The go-to operator is named Thuy, reachable at +84 90 3861479.

When that’s not possible, you’ll have to leave the country on a visa run and request a new visa on arrival.

### How to get a business visa

One to three-month business visas are much readily available in Vietnam than in many of the other ASEAN countries. Arrangements are made by your local sponsor, an established Vietnamese business. Alternately, you can start your own company and sponsor yourself, but that process is outside the scope of this guide.

### How to legally register your business in Vietnam

It’s complicated and not to be grappled with as a recent arrival. You can get further information here: [](http://www.healyconsultants.com/vietnam-company-registration/)[http://www.healyconsultants.com/vietnam-company-registration/](http://www.healyconsultants.com/vietnam-company-registration/) or[](http://www.gbs.com.vn/index.php/en/faq/business-registration/171-guide)[http://www.gbs.com.vn/index.php/en/faq/business-registration/171-guide](http://www.gbs.com.vn/index.php/en/faq/business-registration/171-guide)

### Where and how to recruit local staff for your business

You can recruit solid web developers through the usual means - contacts, referrals and tech meetups. To maximize your likelihood of success, spend time to understand the culture, build a strong network, make it clear that you intend to stick around and offer comprehensive training to any employees you do recruit.

## Play

### Which bars and clubs to visit in Sigon's nightlife

Check AnyArena.com for events.

Lush (Lý Tự Trọng), especially on the infamous Tuesday ladies’ nights.

XU (75 Hai Ba Trung) on Friday’s for a DJ night led by AnyArena’s own DJ Glaser.

Observatory ([](https://www.facebook.com/theobservatoryhcmc)[https://www.facebook.com/theobservatoryhcmc](https://www.facebook.com/theobservatoryhcmc)), in their new space at the Saigon Port (5 Nguyễn Tất Thành, District 4); decidedly Berlin-style - without pretense, smoky, focused on the music and view of the ships outside.

Also, OPPO (242 Cống Quỳnh, Phạm Ngũ Lão), Apocalypse Now (2C Thi Sách), Blanchy’s Tash (95 Hai Ba Trung), Lan Kwai Fong (52 Nguyễn Trãi).

### Where to go to relax (e.g. hot springs, spas, pools, beaches)

There is a water park, Dam Sen, at 3 Hoa Binh Street.

The nearest beach is Vũng Tàu, 125km from Saigon. Take the bus over the hydrofoil. The road is new and the hydrofoil has a tendency to break down or attempt to burn then drown its passengers.

Or take a longer trip to the Phú Quốc island, which served as Vietnam’s largest POW camp during the war, but now tends to serve more pepper and fish sauce (the latter is reportedly the best anywhere). The island is located nearer to Kampot, Cambodia than Vietnam proper. Flying from Saigon is your best option.

Vietnamese massage varies in quality; a consistent method is difficult to discern. The Indochine Spa at 69 Thu Kho Huan St (a block up from iD Cafe) is among the best.

## Extras

Groceries available at co.op marts.

The war museum offers a horrifying and fascinating perspective, notably expunged of virtually any South Vietnamese and coalition forces in favor of, let's say, presenting a tighter narrative.
